[View Webpage Here](https://snoad96.github.io/portfolio-project-one/)

Into The Run is a project I have made to target non-runners and people intrested in getting started, and to explain easier or better ways than just "going for a run".

The three main points on this project are the perfect ways for anyone from any background to get into running or improve their running ability. Users of the site will learn about; 
#### __Circuit.__
#### __Interval.__
#### __Fartlek training.__

## Images

Each page has its own respective image, keeping with the style and theme of the web page, I wanted to keep the images minimal to make sure the webpages didn't seem too cluttered or busy.

## Landing Page

- Each page has similar set up and information so it is easy for the user to figure out where the information is and where the examples of different exercises are for each page.

![Goal](./assets/images/top-webpage.PNG "Goal for exercise")

- Each page has the same information about the workouts, so the user can come to any page and knows similar information.

- Each page has an explanation of each type of exercise and what they are. There are also examples for each type of exercise so that the user can join in straight away! No planning needed.
