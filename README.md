# Into The Run

Into The Run is a project I have made to target non-runners and people intrested in getting started, and to explain easier or better ways than just "going for a run".

The three main points on this project are the perfect ways for anyone from any background to get into running or improve their running ability. Users of the site will learn about; 
#### Circuit.
#### Interval.
#### Fartlek training.
